The **Split Stack CLI Tool** is a command-line utility designed to streamline the process of initializing a project that embraces a split-stack architecture. This architecture combines the best of server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) for enhanced performance and flexibility. The tool helps you set up a project with the following cutting-edge technologies:

- **SvelteKit**: A powerful web meta framework that efficiently handles data fetching, routing, SSR, SSG, and CSR, providing a seamless development experience.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances code maintainability by enabling static type checking.
- **Prisma**: Handles database migrations, models, and connections, simplifying database operations.
- **Lucia**: Offers authentication and authorization capabilities for enhanced security.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Simplifies styling with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Zod**: Provides data validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Express.js**: Optionally integrates with Socket.IO to enable real-time communication.
