The Split Stack CLI Tool is a command-line utility that streamlines setting up a new SvelteKit project with a modern technology stack. With a few prompts, it configures a project with optional integration of TypeScript for type safety, Prisma or Drizzle for database management, Lucia for user authentication, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Socket.IO with Express.js for real-time communication.

To set up a split project, run one of these commands:

### npm

```bash
npx create-split-app
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn dlx create-split-app
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm dlx create-split-app
```
