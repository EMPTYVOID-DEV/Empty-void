## The idea

I have a passion for chess, but I often find myself on the losing side. To address this, I've come up with an intriguing idea: creating a chess bot that is uniquely trained by human expertise.

This chess bot, let's call it 'Eric,' will begin its journey as an absolute noob with a rating of 600 elo. After every game it plays, we will engage in a training process to ensure that it learns from its mistakes and doesn't repeat them. To achieve this, I recognize the need to implement reinforcement learning, although I have no idea how it works (for now).
