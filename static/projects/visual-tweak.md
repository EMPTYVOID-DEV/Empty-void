**Visual-tweak** offers powerful, server-side image manipulation through simple API calls. Built with Next.js and Sharp.js, it provides two key feature packs:

1. **Optimization Pack:** Convert formats, compress, and resize images.
2. **Filters Pack:** Apply effects like blur, sepia, saturation, grayscale, and hue adjustments.

Designed for easy integration, VisualTweak handles various image formats and performs all operations server-side for consistent, efficient results. Perfect for developers looking to streamline image processing in their projects.

### Future improvements

I am looking forward to add other packs like enhancement pack which include sharpening , hdr-effect and noise reduction.
