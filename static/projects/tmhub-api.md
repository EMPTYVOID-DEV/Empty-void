**Tmhub-api** is an API for a CRM that my friend and I built for a client from Norway. We have been told to migrate from Supabase to Express.

We used these tools:

1. **Express** is the backend framework we used.
2. **TypeScript** - obviously, we need type safety.
3. **Zod** is used to validate request bodies.
4. **MariaDB** as the relational database.
5. **Prisma** as the ORM.
6. **lucia-auth** to handle authentication.
